# ðŸš† Train Network Shortest Path Simulator â€“ Dijkstra Algorithm in C

This is a console-based C program that simulates a train station network using a graph structure and implements **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm** to find the shortest paths from a source station to all other stations.

---

ðŸ§¾ **What is it?**  
A simulation of train routes between stations where each station and connection is represented using a graph, and the shortest travel path is calculated from a given starting point using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose:**  
To demonstrate how graph data structures and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm work in practical applications like route optimization and transportation systems.

ðŸ’» **Built With:**  
- C programming language  
- Graph (Adjacency List)  
- Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm  
- Dynamic memory management

---

ðŸ“Œ **Features:**  
- Dynamically creates stations (nodes) and routes (edges)  
- Allows custom weight (distance/time) on each connection  
- Calculates shortest paths from a source station to all others  
- Cleaned up memory after execution

---

ðŸ§ª **How It Works:**  
1. Graph is created with 6 train stations (numbered 0 to 5)  
2. Connections (routes) are added between stations with travel costs  
3. Dijkstra's algorithm is run from station 0  
4. Output shows minimum distance from station 0 to all others
